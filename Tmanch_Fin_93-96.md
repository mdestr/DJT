# Donald Trump’s Financial Dealings (1990–1993)

## Real Estate Acquisitions & Investments (1990–1993)

**Atlantic City Casino Empire:** Trump’s expansion into Atlantic City culminated in three major casinos – Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the Trump Taj Mahal – but by the early 1990s these ventures were drowning in debt. The crown jewel, **Trump Taj Mahal**, opened in April 1990 for around $1 billion and was financed by a **$675 million “junk bond” issue at 14% interest** ([ In Re Donald J. Trump Casino Securities Litigation, 793 F. Supp. 543 (D.N.J. 1992) :: Justia](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/793/543/1369115/#:~:text=The%20Taj%20Mahal%20%28,the%20prospectus)). This high-cost debt meant the Taj Mahal needed **about $94 million a year (roughly $1.3 million a day) just to cover interest** ([Trump Bankruptcy in Atlantic City. Taj Mahal & Trump Plaza.](https://www.njcasino.com/news/trump-atlantic-city#:~:text=The%20Taj%20was%20financed%20with,a%20day%20to%20be%20profitable)) – an unprecedented burden no casino could sustain. Within months, the Taj began defaulting on payments, and by 1991 it **was nearly $3 billion in debt** ([PolitiFact | Fact-checking claims about Donald Trump's four bankruptcies](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/#:~:text=The%20first%20bankruptcy%20associated%20with,to%20the%20Washington%20Post)). Trump’s company filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the Taj in July 1991. Under the court-approved restructuring, **Trump ceded 50% ownership of the Taj to bondholders and agreed to sell off personal assets** (notably his airline, the Trump Shuttle, and his mega-yacht) to reduce debt ([PolitiFact | Fact-checking claims about Donald Trump's four bankruptcies](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/#:~:text=The%20first%20bankruptcy%20associated%20with,to%20the%20Washington%20Post)). Despite the bankruptcy, Trump was allowed to remain as the casino’s operator/figurehead. The **Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino** (Atlantic City) and **Trump’s Castle (later Trump Marina)** soon followed suit: both casinos filed pre-packaged bankruptcies in 1992 and reorganized their debt. Trump’s company **relinquished roughly half its stake in Trump Castle to bondholders in 1992** to reduce obligations ([Donald Trump Business Bankruptcies: List and Reasons](https://www.thoughtco.com/donald-trump-business-bankruptcies-4152019#:~:text=The%20Castle%20Hotel%20%26%20Casino,new%20name%2C%20the%20Golden%20Nugget)), and Trump Plaza casino also underwent a debt restructuring in 1992 ([Donald Trump Business Bankruptcies: List and Reasons](https://www.thoughtco.com/donald-trump-business-bankruptcies-4152019#:~:text=The%20Trump%20Plaza%20Hotel%20and,filed%20bankruptcy%20in%20March%201992)). In each case, Trump gave up equity to creditors but managed to **keep a role in the casinos post-reorganization**, preserving his name on the properties.

In 1991, Trump’s company filed bankruptcy for the Taj, and Trump forfeited half his stake to bondholders and lowered the casino’s crushing interest costs ([PolitiFact | Fact-checking claims about Donald Trump's four bankruptcies](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/#:~:text=The%20first%20bankruptcy%20associated%20with,to%20the%20Washington%20Post)) ([Trump Bankruptcy in Atlantic City. Taj Mahal & Trump Plaza.](https://www.njcasino.com/news/trump-atlantic-city#:~:text=The%20Taj%20was%20financed%20with,a%20day%20to%20be%20profitable)).*  

**New York Properties and Deals:** Trump’s aggressive 1980s acquisitions in Manhattan also hit hard times by 1990–93. His most high-profile holding, the **Plaza Hotel in Manhattan**, was purchased in 1988 for $390 million (mostly borrowed) – a record price that left the hotel heavily leveraged ([PolitiFact | Fact-checking claims about Donald Trump's four bankruptcies](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/#:~:text=Bankruptcy%202%3A%20Trump%20Plaza%20Hotel%2C,1992)). By 1992 the Plaza was **over $550 million in debt** and could no longer pay its $25 million annual interest payments ([Donald Trump Business Bankruptcies: List and Reasons](https://www.thoughtco.com/donald-trump-business-bankruptcies-4152019#:~:text=Trump%27s%20Plaza%20Hotel%20was%20more,day%20role%20in%20its%20operations)). The Plaza Hotel filed for Chapter 11 in 1992; in the resulting deal, **Trump gave up a 49% stake in the Plaza to a consortium of six lenders in exchange for more favorable terms on the remaining debt** ([PolitiFact | Fact-checking claims about Donald Trump's four bankruptcies](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/#:~:text=Trump%20acquired%20the%20Plaza%20Hotel,the%20New%20York%20Times)). He was allowed to remain as the Plaza’s CEO, but this was in name only – **he drew no salary and ceded operational control** to a new board ([PolitiFact | Fact-checking claims about Donald Trump's four bankruptcies](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/#:~:text=Trump%20acquired%20the%20Plaza%20Hotel,the%20New%20York%20Times)). Effectively, Trump lost majority ownership of the Plaza Hotel as of 1992, marking a dramatic fall for one of New York’s landmark properties. Outside the Plaza, Trump’s other NYC assets were limited in this period. Trump Tower (opened 1983) continued to generate revenue, but he **had to halt or sell off new projects**. For example, his planned West Side redevelopment (Television City) stalled for lack of funds until foreign investors stepped in (see **International Ties** below). Trump also **surrendered his Trump Shuttle airline in 1991–1992** to creditors (who later sold it to USAir) as the shuttle operation was bleeding cash ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=In%201989%20Trump%20acquired%20the,it%20outright%20five%20years%20later)) ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=Trump%2C%20who%20was%20bumped%20from,in%20the%20Plaza%2C%20and%20the)). To appease his bankers, in **August 1990 Trump put up several of his marquee assets (including the three Atlantic City casinos and the Plaza Hotel) as collateral** to forestall default ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=The%20loss%20of%20the%20shuttle,from%20his%20major%20bank%20lenders)). In short, by 1991–92 Trump’s real estate empire was undergoing forced contraction: trophy assets were placed under creditor control or sold, and development plans were postponed, all in an effort to reduce his staggering debt load.

 ([File:New York - Manhattan - Plaza Hotel.jpg - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:New_York_-_Manhattan_-_Plaza_Hotel.jpg)) *The Plaza Hotel in New York – purchased by Trump in 1988 – fell into **financial distress** by 1992 with $550 million in debt. Trump’s Plaza Hotel entered bankruptcy and he **relinquished 49% ownership to lenders** in exchange for debt relief ([Donald Trump Business Bankruptcies: List and Reasons](https://www.thoughtco.com/donald-trump-business-bankruptcies-4152019#:~:text=Trump%27s%20Plaza%20Hotel%20was%20more,day%20role%20in%20its%20operations)). Trump kept a figurehead role but lost operational control ([PolitiFact | Fact-checking claims about Donald Trump's four bankruptcies](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/#:~:text=Trump%20acquired%20the%20Plaza%20Hotel,the%20New%20York%20Times)).*  

**Financing Structures and Debt Workouts:** Trump’s 1980s expansion was fueled by **high-leverage financing** – he often bought properties with minimal equity, relying on bank loans or bonds. The Trump Taj Mahal’s funding through **14% interest bonds** is a prime example of the risky capital structure that led to trouble ([ In Re Donald J. Trump Casino Securities Litigation, 793 F. Supp. 543 (D.N.J. 1992) :: Justia](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/793/543/1369115/#:~:text=The%20Taj%20Mahal%20%28,the%20prospectus)). When the real estate market softened around 1990, Trump **ran out of cash and faced an unsustainable debt load**. By early 1990 he owed **approximately $4 billion to more than 70 banks**, with **about $800 million personally guaranteed by Trump himself** ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=As%20the%20real%20estate%20market,Trump%20ran%20out%20of%20cash)). Facing a personal financial collapse, Trump’s only option was to negotiate massive debt restructurings. A consortium of his major lenders (led by Citibank) formed a “workout” committee in 1990 to prevent a total default. According to bankers involved, the negotiations were driven by the banks’ desire to **maximize their recovery – essentially a bank-led bailout** ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=The%20six%20bankers%20and%20lawyers,for%20the%20banks%2C%20not%20Trump)) ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=The%20six%20bankers%20and%20lawyers,for%20the%20banks%2C%20not%20Trump)). In June 1990, as Trump teetered on default, the banks agreed to **restructure Trump’s loans and postpone payments**: they gave him an emergency line of credit and put him on a tight budget. Notably, the banks provided Trump a **$450,000 monthly allowance** to cover operating expenses and personal living costs during the workout, but this stipend came with strict oversight ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=That%20proposal%20was%20vetoed,several%20of%20the%20negotiators%20said)). Trump had to **submit to weekly monitoring by bank advisors and sign over discretionary control** of many business decisions to its creditors ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=would%20then%20be%20split%20among,the%20banks)). In exchange, the lenders deferred some interest and **forgave a portion of Trump’s personal debt** – but only after Trump **pledged virtually all his remaining assets as collateral** ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=in%20the%20talks%20said)) ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=would%20then%20be%20split%20among,the%20banks)). He even agreed that if he failed to comply with the turnaround plan, the banks could **seize his personal assets (including his 727 jet and even his Mar-a-Lago estate)** ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=These%20individuals%20said%20the%20banks,be%20split%20among%20the%20banks)). This 1990–91 debt workout was essentially a private reorganization: Trump **avoided personal bankruptcy, but only because the banks stood to lose more by forcing him into default**. As one lawyer who led the talks noted, the banks concluded they’d **“recover more of the $4 billion by selling Trump’s assets slowly, rather than foreclosing immediately”** ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=The%20banks%C2%A0decided%20they%20could%20recover,participants%20in%20the%20talks%20said)). As a result, through 1991–1993 Trump **sold off numerous holdings** under bank supervision – including his airline, yacht, and stakes in various projects – to chip away at debt ([PolitiFact | Fact-checking claims about Donald Trump's four bankruptcies](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/#:~:text=The%20first%20bankruptcy%20associated%20with,to%20the%20Washington%20Post)). The outcome left his business empire shrunken but not erased: Trump retained minority stakes or managerial roles in key properties (like the casinos and Plaza) but **lost majority ownership and future upside in many of them** ([PolitiFact | Fact-checking claims about Donald Trump's four bankruptcies](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/#:~:text=according%20to%20the%20New%20York,to%20the%20Washington%20Post)) ([Donald Trump Business Bankruptcies: List and Reasons](https://www.thoughtco.com/donald-trump-business-bankruptcies-4152019#:~:text=Trump%27s%20Plaza%20Hotel%20was%20more,day%20role%20in%20its%20operations)). Several major lenders wrote off losses and, notably, **some banks vowed never to lend to Trump again** after the painful workout ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=the%20timing%20of%20the%20sales%2C,Citibank%20eventually%20sold%20The%20Plaza)). In Trump’s narrative, this period was “the art of the comeback,” but contemporary accounts credit the lender consortium – effectively treating Trump as “too big to fail” – with rescuing him from complete ruin ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=Six%20people%20who%20participated%20in,survivor%20and%20a%20master%20negotiator)) ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=The%20six%20bankers%20and%20lawyers,for%20the%20banks%2C%20not%20Trump)).

## International Financial Ties

**Middle Eastern (Saudi) Bailouts:** During the 1990–93 crunch, Trump turned to foreign investors to raise cash from his beleaguered assets. A prominent example is Trump’s relationship with **Saudi Arabia’s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal**, a billionaire who effectively bailed Trump out twice. In 1991, as Trump was “*teetering on personal bankruptcy and scrambling to raise cash*,” he **sold his 282-foot luxury yacht, the Trump Princess, to Prince Alwaleed for around $20 million** ([Trump's business ties to kingdom run long and deep | Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/trumps-business-ties-to-kingdom-run-long-and-deep#:~:text=FILE%20,biggest%20critics%2C%20journalist%20and%20activist)) ([Trump's business ties to kingdom run long and deep | Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/trumps-business-ties-to-kingdom-run-long-and-deep#:~:text=In%201991%2C%20as%20Trump%20was,he%20reportedly%20paid%20for%20it)). This fire-sale price was *about one-third less* than Trump had paid for the yacht just a few years earlier, underscoring his desperation ([Trump's business ties to kingdom run long and deep | Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/trumps-business-ties-to-kingdom-run-long-and-deep#:~:text=FILE%20,biggest%20critics%2C%20journalist%20and%20activist)). The quick infusion helped Trump meet pressing debt payments. Four years later, in 1995, Alwaleed came to Trump’s aid again by leading a deal to purchase the **Plaza Hotel**. The Plaza was a money-losing property under Trump, so that year **Alwaleed joined with other investors (including Singapore-based Kwek Leng Beng’s CDL group) to buy the Plaza for $325 million** ([Trump Has Deep Ties With Saudis, From Selling Yacht to Sword-Dancing - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-has-deep-ties-with-saudis-from-selling-yacht-to-sword-dancing-2018-10#:~:text=than%20he%20paid%20for%20it)) ([Trump's business ties to kingdom run long and deep | Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/trumps-business-ties-to-kingdom-run-long-and-deep#:~:text=In%201991%2C%20as%20Trump%20was,he%20reportedly%20paid%20for%20it)). This deal allowed Trump’s lenders (primarily Citibank) to recover much of their capital; Trump himself was pushed out, retaining no equity by that point. The **1995 Plaza sale (though just outside our 1990–93 window) was negotiated as a direct result of Trump’s early-’90s insolvency**, and it highlighted the role of foreign capital in salvaging his holdings. Trump himself later acknowledged, “I love the Saudis…many are in this building,” referring to Saudi money in his properties ([Trump's business ties to kingdom run long and deep | Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/trumps-business-ties-to-kingdom-run-long-and-deep#:~:text=He%27s%20booked%20hotel%20rooms%20and,Plaza%20Hotel%20overlooking%20Central%20Park)). Indeed, beyond the yacht and Plaza, Saudi clientele would continue to be a lucrative source of cash (for example, the Saudi government and royals would book entire floors in Trump hotels in later years). The critical point is that **in Trump’s time of greatest financial need, a Saudi investor provided millions to shore up his liquidity**, helping Trump survive when domestic buyers were scarce.

**Deals with Hong Kong Investors:** Another lifeline for Trump’s real estate came from Asia. In 1994, a consortium of **Hong Kong billionaires (led by Henry Cheng and Vincent Lo)** struck a deal to invest in Trump’s ambitious (but stalled) West Side development project in Manhattan. Trump had long planned to build “Television City” on a 77-acre rail yard tract on the Upper West Side, but by 1990 the project – later known as **Riverside South** – was moribund due to Trump’s debts. **Unable to afford the carrying costs or development expenses**, Trump sought investors. In 1994, he reached an agreement with a group of Hong Kong developers who essentially **rescued him from the verge of bankruptcy on that project** ([Donald Trump soured on a deal, and Hong Kong partners became litigants](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/donald-trump-soured-on-a-deal-and-hong-kong-partners-became-litigants-116060100053_1.html#:~:text=It%20began%20when%20a%20group,of%20his%20properties%20in%20Manhattan)) ([Donald Trump soured on a deal, and Hong Kong partners became litigants](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/donald-trump-soured-on-a-deal-and-hong-kong-partners-became-litigants-116060100053_1.html#:~:text=Their%20partnership%20began%20in%201994%2C,alone%20to%20develop%20the%20property)). The Asian group (which included Cheng, chairman of New World Development, and Lo, a major Shanghai developer) **agreed to buy the West Side land, assume about $250 million of Trump’s debt, and pay Trump a minority share of future profits (approximately 30%)** ([Donald Trump soured on a deal, and Hong Kong partners became litigants](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/donald-trump-soured-on-a-deal-and-hong-kong-partners-became-litigants-116060100053_1.html#:~:text=In%20need%20of%20cash%2C%20he,in%20more%20ways%20than%20one)). They also paid Trump fees to continue as a nominal development partner ([Donald Trump soured on a deal, and Hong Kong partners became litigants](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/donald-trump-soured-on-a-deal-and-hong-kong-partners-became-litigants-116060100053_1.html#:~:text=In%20need%20of%20cash%2C%20he,in%20more%20ways%20than%20one)). In effect, the Hong Kong investors injected the capital needed to develop the site (which Trump alone could not raise), while **Trump contributed the land and his name in return for a small equity upside**. This partnership allowed Trump to avoid defaulting on the property – a **crucial international bailout for his NYC real estate**. For several years, the arrangement was mutually beneficial: the Hong Kong-led consortium built out the multi-tower complex (later known as Trump Place), and Trump shared in some proceeds without having to invest money. However, when the Asian partners decided to sell the finished buildings in 2005, Trump bitterly (and unsuccessfully) sued them – a sign of his frustration at having lost control of the project he once envisioned ([Donald Trump soured on a deal, and Hong Kong partners became litigants](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/donald-trump-soured-on-a-deal-and-hong-kong-partners-became-litigants-116060100053_1.html#:~:text=But%20when%20his%20Hong%20Kong,fruitful%20relationship%20with%20aggressive%20litigation)) ([Donald Trump soured on a deal, and Hong Kong partners became litigants](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/donald-trump-soured-on-a-deal-and-hong-kong-partners-became-litigants-116060100053_1.html#:~:text=develop%20the%20property)). Nonetheless, back in 1994 this deal was a clear win for Trump: foreign capital saved one of his largest assets from foreclosure. It stands out as perhaps the **closest Trump came to a formal international partnership during that era**, and it showcased his willingness to concede ownership to foreign entities in exchange for debt relief.

**Russian and Post-Soviet Funds:** In the early 1990s, Trump had no known major business ventures in Russia, but the collapse of his U.S. creditworthiness in that period paved the way for a greater **reliance on Russian and Eastern European money later in the decade**. By 1992, after multiple business bankruptcies, Trump’s reputation among U.S. banks was severely damaged – one finance expert noted that Trump had become “**poison to most major lenders**” by that juncture ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=businesses%20had%20declared%20bankruptcy%2C%20the,financial%20industry%20at%20that%20juncture)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=borrowers%20repeatedly%20file%20for%20protection,financial%20industry%20at%20that%20juncture)). Indeed, **virtually no American bank would lend to Trump for much of the 1990s** ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20former%20longtime%20architect%2C%20Alan,%E2%80%9D)). To keep his real estate ventures alive, Trump and his organization increasingly welcomed foreign buyers and investors, especially from the former Soviet Union. As Foreign Policy reported, **“foreign money played a large role in reviving his fortunes,” particularly wealth from Russia and ex-Soviet republics** ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=But%20Trump%20eventually%20made%20a,%E2%80%9D)). This took the form of **condo sales to shell companies linked to Russian oligarchs and criminals, and partnerships on development projects** where offshore capital was involved. Trump’s own son, Donald Jr., later commented in 2008 that “**Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets**,” referring to property sales ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=evidence%20www,%E2%80%9D)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=and%20the%20Southern%20District%20of,%E2%80%9D)). One of Trump’s long-time architects, Alan Lapidus, said that after Trump’s early-‘90s collapse, **“he could not get anybody in the United States to lend him anything. It was all coming out of Russia”**, implying Trump’s projects were floated by Russian funds when U.S. financing dried up ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20former%20longtime%20architect%2C%20Alan,%E2%80%9D)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20former%20longtime%20architect%2C%20Alan,%E2%80%9D)). Examples include the flood of cash buyers from former USSR who purchased luxury condos in Trump Tower and other Trump-branded buildings throughout the 1990s. While these transactions were not always public, journalists and later investigations have noted **credible allegations of Trump properties being used to launder money by Russian mobsters and corrupt businessmen during the ’90s and 2000s** ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business - Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=How%20Russian%20Money%20Helped%20Save,oligarchs%2C%20criminals%2C%20and%20regime)). In summary, **Trump’s survival through the 1990s was significantly buoyed by foreign capital** – from Middle Eastern royalty to Asian tycoons and post-Soviet elites. With U.S. banks unwilling to extend credit, Trump turned to selling assets and equity abroad. These international financial ties helped Trump stabilize his business by the mid-1990s, albeit at the cost of **increased reliance on potentially opaque sources of money** and loss of ownership in marquee properties.

**Offshore Entities and Other Foreign Links:** Trump’s businesses in this period also interacted with offshore finance in various ways. For instance, to raise public bond financing for his Atlantic City casinos in the 1980s, Trump used separate corporate entities – e.g., “Trump Plaza Funding, Inc.” – incorporated outside of casino regulation to issue debt ([Trump’s $916 million of NOLs: The Art of the Dodge? | Tax Policy Center](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/trumps-916-million-nols-art-dodge#:~:text=Consider%20the%20Plaza%20casino%2C%20one,were%20guaranteed%20by%20Plaza%20Partnership)). (This allowed public investors to buy casino bonds without being licensed as casino owners by New Jersey.) There were also instances of **unusual foreign buyers** snapping up Trump real estate. In one notable case just before this period (1989), a Russian-born buyer (David Bogatin) purchased five Trump Tower condos for $6 million in cash – a deal later scrutinized as possible money laundering – though Bogatin fled and the U.S. government seized those units in 1993, alleging they were bought with illicit funds from Eastern European organized crime ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=But%20Trump%20eventually%20made%20a,%E2%80%9D)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20former%20longtime%20architect%2C%20Alan,%E2%80%9D)). Such transactions underscored that **Trump’s high-end properties had become a magnet for overseas investors looking to park money in the West**, sometimes with little transparency. While Trump may not have orchestrated these deals for illicit purposes, the pattern of **foreign shell companies buying Trump condos in bulk** raised red flags for financial crime experts over the years. Overall, between 1990 and 1993, Trump’s direct international deals mainly involved selling assets to foreign interests (as described above). But this era laid the groundwork for an influx of foreign capital that would define Trump’s business strategy going forward: **after being shunned by traditional banks, he increasingly courted wealthy foreigners and offshore funds to invest in Trump-branded projects** – a trend that intensified in the later 1990s and beyond ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=But%20Trump%20eventually%20made%20a,%E2%80%9D)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20former%20longtime%20architect%2C%20Alan,%E2%80%9D)).

## Legal Disputes & Regulatory Scrutiny

**Bankruptcies and Debt Restructurings:** Trump’s businesses underwent an unprecedented string of bankruptcies and restructurings in the early ’90s, triggering legal processes and creditor disputes. In total, **three Trump entities filed Chapter 11 within 18 months**: the Trump Taj Mahal in 1991, and Trump’s Castle casino and the Plaza Hotel (NYC) in 1992 ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=Trump%2C%20who%20was%20bumped%20from,in%20the%20Plaza%2C%20and%20the)). These were **Chapter 11 reorganizations** (corporate bankruptcies aimed at reducing debt while keeping the business running). The **Taj Mahal’s bankruptcy (1991)** was especially high-profile. With $3 billion in liabilities, the Taj’s Chapter 11 plan slashed interest rates on its bonds and converted half the bond debt into equity for the bondholders ([PolitiFact | Fact-checking claims about Donald Trump's four bankruptcies](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/#:~:text=The%20first%20bankruptcy%20associated%20with,to%20the%20Washington%20Post)). This left many original investors with heavy losses – indeed, **Taj bondholders ultimately received new bonds worth only $0.90 on the dollar of the original debt** ([Trump’s $916 million of NOLs: The Art of the Dodge? | Tax Policy Center](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/trumps-916-million-nols-art-dodge#:~:text=In%201992%2C%20Plaza%20Funding%20,preferred%20interest%20in%20Plaza%20Partnership)) ([Trump’s $916 million of NOLs: The Art of the Dodge? | Tax Policy Center](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/trumps-916-million-nols-art-dodge#:~:text=Normally%2C%20a%20borrower%20such%20as,for%20a%20partnership%20in%20bankruptcy)) (and even that was optimistic since the casino’s future earnings were uncertain). Trump’s **Trump Castle and Trump Plaza casinos entered bankruptcy in March 1992** after bondholder negotiations as well ([Donald Trump Business Bankruptcies: List and Reasons](https://www.thoughtco.com/donald-trump-business-bankruptcies-4152019#:~:text=The%20Trump%20Plaza%20Hotel%20and,filed%20bankruptcy%20in%20March%201992)). At Trump’s Castle, the Trump Organization gave up 50% ownership to bondholders in exchange for restructuring the debt and lowering interest payments ([Donald Trump Business Bankruptcies: List and Reasons](https://www.thoughtco.com/donald-trump-business-bankruptcies-4152019#:~:text=The%20Castle%20Hotel%20%26%20Casino,new%20name%2C%20the%20Golden%20Nugget)). The **Plaza Hotel’s 1992 bankruptcy** was resolved by a deal in which Trump ceded 49% of the hotel to a group of banks (Citibank and others) and gave up management control ([PolitiFact | Fact-checking claims about Donald Trump's four bankruptcies](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/#:~:text=Trump%20acquired%20the%20Plaza%20Hotel,the%20New%20York%20Times)). Trump **personally guaranteed much of the Plaza’s $550 million debt**, so this deal saved him from personal default at the cost of his equity. Each bankruptcy involved **complex negotiations and, at times, court fights**. For example, Taj Mahal bondholders sued Trump and his underwriters in a class-action (the *Trump Taj Mahal Securities Litigation*) alleging they were misled about the casino’s prospects ([ In Re Donald J. Trump Casino Securities Litigation, 793 F. Supp. 543 (D.N.J. 1992) :: Justia](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/793/543/1369115/#:~:text=After%20learning%20that%20the%20Taj,Plaintiffs%20await%20class%20certification)). That lawsuit was tentatively settled in 1991 as part of the reorganization plan ([ In Re Donald J. Trump Casino Securities Litigation, 793 F. Supp. 543 (D.N.J. 1992) :: Justia](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/793/543/1369115/#:~:text=In%20May%2C%201991%2C%20the%20parties,dismiss%2C%20filed%20jointly%20by%20the)). In the Plaza Hotel case, a group of banks initially sparred over terms, but eventually all agreed to the Chapter 11 plan to avoid protracted litigation. It’s important to note that **Trump himself did not file personal bankruptcy**, but these corporate bankruptcies were major legal events that allowed Trump to escape billions in debt. Creditors often accepted **equity or less-than-full payment rather than force liquidation**, calculating that was the best they could do. Still, **many creditors and contractors felt burned**. As one newspaper later summed up: “the burden of his failures fell on investors and others who had bet on his business acumen” ([Donald Trump Business Bankruptcies: List and Reasons](https://www.thoughtco.com/donald-trump-business-bankruptcies-4152019#:~:text=,bet%20on%20his%20business%20acumen)). 

**Contractor and Creditor Lawsuits:** Trump’s habit of using other people’s money meant that when his projects faltered, **hundreds of contractors, suppliers, and small businesses were left unpaid or underpaid**, leading to a flurry of lawsuits in 1990–1993. Nowhere was this more evident than the Taj Mahal’s collapse. By mid-1990, **about 100 vendors at the newly-opened Taj Mahal had not been paid in full** ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=About%20100%20vendors%20at%20the,more%20than%2020%20years%20old)). These ranged from major construction contractors owed millions to local businesses owed tens of thousands of dollars. For example, **Bogart Graphics, a family-owned printing company, sued the Trump Taj Mahal in March 1991 over a $36,000 unpaid bill** for casino stationery and promotional materials ([Lawsuit pitted Trump, Erie printer

Donald Trump saw his Trump Taj Mahal casino sued in Erie County Court in 1991 over a debt](https://www.goerie.com/story/news/2020/10/25/lawsuit-once-pitted-trump-erie-printer-donald-trump-saw-his-trump-taj-mahal-casino-sued-over-debt-er/3586216001/#:~:text=The%20Trump%20Taj%20Mahal%20was,they%20would%20ever%20get%20paid)). Many of these creditors filed mechanics’ liens or lawsuits to protect their claims. When the Taj Mahal went bankrupt in 1991, those claims were addressed in court: small vendors often had to settle for partial payments over time. (Bogart Graphics, for instance, only got paid in full *after* the Taj’s bankruptcy reorganization, and that was because the casino agreed to continue doing business with them post-bankruptcy to work off the debt ([Lawsuit pitted Trump, Erie printer

Larger contractors fared worse: **Trump’s bankruptcy meant several contractors never saw the money owed for their work**. A later tally of Taj Mahal construction claims showed numerous unpaid bills: *$2 million* owed to the maker of the Taj’s ornate onion dome, *$1.1 million* to a glass installer, *$3.9 million* to a marble supplier, *$580,000* to the cleanup contractor, and so on ([Trump Bankruptcy in Atlantic City. Taj Mahal & Trump Plaza.](https://www.njcasino.com/news/trump-atlantic-city#:~:text=,had%20to%20lay%20off%20his)) ([Trump Bankruptcy in Atlantic City. Taj Mahal & Trump Plaza.](https://www.njcasino.com/news/trump-atlantic-city#:~:text=The%20contractor%20who%20made%C2%A0the%20Taj%E2%80%99s,to%20lay%20off%20his%20brother)). Some of these businesses were pushed to the brink: the marble supplier for the Taj eventually filed personal bankruptcy, and a partition installer had to lay off employees due to the losses ([Trump Bankruptcy in Atlantic City. Taj Mahal & Trump Plaza.](https://www.njcasino.com/news/trump-atlantic-city#:~:text=The%20contractor%20who%20made%C2%A0the%20Taj%E2%80%99s,to%20lay%20off%20his%20brother)). Similarly, at **Trump’s Castle**, dozens of contractors went unpaid until that bankruptcy was resolved – often accepting dimes on the dollar. Trump’s failure to pay contractors became so notorious that by 1992 it was fodder for local courts and media. It also led to **a pattern of litigation** that would continue throughout Trump’s career (USA Today later documented over 3,500 lawsuits involving Trump, many for unpaid bills). In the early ’90s, this strained Trump’s relationships: Atlantic City’s local contractors grew wary of doing business with him, and some filed liens on his properties. Creditors such as banks also pursued legal remedies. In 1990, Trump owed **$30 million in interest to a syndicate of banks due on his casino debts**, and when he missed payments, the banks prepared default notices. Rather than sue immediately, they leveraged that threat to enforce the restructurings noted above. Overall, Trump’s financial crisis triggered a **cascade of legal disputes – bankruptcy proceedings, creditor lawsuits, lien claims, and contract disputes – in New Jersey, New York, and beyond**. Many were settled as part of the bankruptcy plans, but the public record is replete with angry subcontractors and creditors who felt shortchanged.

**Regulatory Scrutiny – Casino Oversight:** As an Atlantic City casino owner, Trump was subject to intensive regulation by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission (CCC) and Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE). The early ’90s tested those regulators as Trump’s financial troubles raised concerns about the **continued viability and integrity of his casinos**. New Jersey law requires casino licensees to maintain financial stability and honest conduct. In 1990, as the Trump Taj Mahal verged on default just months after opening, regulators took notice. In fact, the **Casino Control Commission explicitly warned in mid-1991 that it might not renew Trump’s casino licenses unless he restructured his debts and paid his overdue obligations to bondholders** ([Trump pulls off last-minute deal - UPI Archives](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/06/17/Trump-pulls-off-last-minute-deal/9831677131200/#:~:text=The%20casino%20commission%20had%20warned,or%20renegotiated%20the%20debt)). This pressure contributed to Trump striking a last-minute deal with Taj Mahal bondholders in 1991 to avoid a license suspension. Behind the scenes, New Jersey regulators were coordinating with Trump’s banks to ensure the casinos could keep operating. One commissioner later reflected that the agency effectively decided Trump was “**too big to fail**” for Atlantic City – shutting down his casinos would have hurt the local economy and state revenues ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=That%20moment%2C%20when%20New%20Jersey%E2%80%99s,and%20now%2C%20don%E2%80%99t%20understand%20Trump)). Instead, regulators allowed the casinos to continue under bankruptcy protection, albeit under close monitoring. The DGE and CCC held frequent hearings on the Trump casinos’ financial status. In April 1990, **gaming regulators released a report showing Trump was down to only $1.6 million in available cash** – a startling low figure given his massive obligations ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=In%20April%20casino%20regulators%20made,6%20million)). This public disclosure added pressure on Trump to find new financing. Regulators also scrutinized specific transactions: in one instance, **Trump’s father, Fred Trump, attempted to help by purchasing $3.3 million in casino chips at Trump’s Castle in late 1990, then not gambling with them (essentially an undocumented loan)** ([Poker Chip Bailout: What Donald Trump and 'Hell or High Water' Have in Common - TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-hell-or-high-water/#:~:text=That%20was%20one%20thing%20we,to%20leave%C2%A0without%20cashing%20them%20in)). The New Jersey DGE investigated this “chip purchase” and later ruled it an **illegal, back-door loan** to the casino. While **the Castle was allowed to keep the $3.3 million infusion, the casino was fined $30,000 for violating regulations** ([Poker Chip Bailout: What Donald Trump and 'Hell or High Water' Have in Common - TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-hell-or-high-water/#:~:text=New%20Jersey%E2%80%99s%C2%A0state%20Division%20of%20Gaming,a%201991%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer%20story)). (Notably, the DGE chose not to sanction Donald Trump personally, but the incident was a clear breach of casino finance rules.) In another case, the **Trump Plaza casino was fined $200,000 in 1991 for violating anti-discrimination rules and catering to a high roller’s improper demands** ([Trump Plaza fined $200,000 for discrimination - UPI Archives](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/06/06/Trump-Plaza-fined-200000-for-discrimination/2869676180800/#:~:text=The%20discrimination%20fine%20resulted%20from,consultant%20who%20lost%20millions)). The high roller in question was Robert LiButti, a notorious gambler with reported ties to organized crime. Trump Plaza managers, eager to keep LiButti gambling, **moved African-American and female dealers off his tables at his request** – a discriminatory practice that the Casino Control Commission punished with the hefty fine ([Trump Plaza fined $200,000 for discrimination - UPI Archives](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/06/06/Trump-Plaza-fined-200000-for-discrimination/2869676180800/#:~:text=The%20discrimination%20fine%20resulted%20from,consultant%20who%20lost%20millions)). LiButti’s large cash transactions at Trump’s casinos (he lost millions) also drew the eye of regulators concerned about **money laundering**; he was later banned from NJ casinos for his mob connections. These episodes show that even as Trump struggled to pay bills, his casinos were being written up for **regulatory violations – from financial improprieties to compliance failures**. The New Jersey authorities in some ways propped Trump up (by allowing the casinos to operate through bankruptcy), but they also extracted penalties and imposed conditions. For example, as part of the 1991 Taj Mahal proceedings, the CCC installed an overseer to ensure the casino’s revenues went toward mandated payments to bondholders ([Trump pulls off last-minute deal - UPI Archives](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/06/17/Trump-pulls-off-last-minute-deal/9831677131200/#:~:text=The%20casino%20commission%20had%20warned,or%20renegotiated%20the%20debt)). In sum, **state regulators kept Trump’s casinos on a tight leash during 1990–93**, intervening whenever his financial maneuvers crossed legal lines or threatened the casinos’ stability.

**Tax Investigations and Federal Scrutiny:** Trump’s complex finances and high-profile losses also drew the attention of tax authorities and federal regulators, though direct punitive action in 1990–93 was limited. It later emerged that Trump’s tax strategy during this period was extremely aggressive. For instance, Trump reported **huge net operating losses (NOLs) – up to $916 million by 1995 – largely stemming from the early ’90s collapse** ([Poker Chip Bailout: What Donald Trump and 'Hell or High Water' Have in Common - TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-hell-or-high-water/#:~:text=The%20tale%20of%20the%20chips,questions%20about%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20business%20acumen)). These losses became a tax shelter, potentially allowing him to avoid federal income taxes for up to 18 years ([Trump’s $916 million of NOLs: The Art of the Dodge? | Tax Policy Center](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/trumps-916-million-nols-art-dodge#:~:text=casinos,taxes%20for%20nearly%20two%20decades)). Tax experts noted that **Trump had likely taken deductions for forgiven debt and investment losses that, while perhaps legal, “aggressively stretched the law”** ([Trump’s $916 million of NOLs: The Art of the Dodge? | Tax Policy Center](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/trumps-916-million-nols-art-dodge#:~:text=We%20have%20no%20evidence%20that,his%20%24916%20million%20of%20NOLs)). Normally, debt forgiveness counts as taxable income, but Trump’s lawyers exploited loopholes (like the since-repealed “stock-for-debt” exception) to **avoid reporting any cancellation-of-debt income from his 1990s restructurings** ([Trump’s $916 million of NOLs: The Art of the Dodge? | Tax Policy Center](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/trumps-916-million-nols-art-dodge#:~:text=In%20the%20early%201990s%2C%20Trump,IRS%20ever%20challenged%20his%20position)) ([Trump’s $916 million of NOLs: The Art of the Dodge? | Tax Policy Center](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/trumps-916-million-nols-art-dodge#:~:text=In%201992%2C%20Plaza%20Funding%20,preferred%20interest%20in%20Plaza%20Partnership)). According to documents from his Plaza casino bankruptcy, **Trump’s partnership took the position that Trump personally would recognize *no* income from wiping out portions of the Plaza’s $250 million bond debt** – even though ordinarily a $25 million debt reduction would be taxable ([Trump’s $916 million of NOLs: The Art of the Dodge? | Tax Policy Center](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/trumps-916-million-nols-art-dodge#:~:text=In%201992%2C%20Plaza%20Funding%20,preferred%20interest%20in%20Plaza%20Partnership)) ([Trump’s $916 million of NOLs: The Art of the Dodge? | Tax Policy Center](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/trumps-916-million-nols-art-dodge#:~:text=Normally%2C%20a%20borrower%20such%20as,for%20a%20partnership%20in%20bankruptcy)). The IRS was aware of such strategies and later tightened the rules, but it’s not publicly known if Trump’s specific tax positions in 1991–93 were audited or challenged. What *is* known is that **by 1993 Trump had likely paid little to no federal income tax for several years**, thanks to his business losses and clever accounting (Trump himself boasted in later debates that not paying taxes “makes me smart”). In terms of legal jeopardy, Trump did face one significant federal penalty around this time: **in 1991 he paid a $750,000 civil fine to the FTC to settle charges that he violated the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act** (the pre-merger notification law) ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=,federal%20judge%20sanctioned%20the%20deal)). This stemmed from Trump’s late-1980s purchases of stock in two gaming companies (Holiday Corp. and Bally) – he had acquired large stakes without timely reporting to antitrust regulators, allegedly with the intent of pressuring management (a practice known as greenmail). The FTC and Justice Department investigated and fined him, with Trump neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=,federal%20judge%20sanctioned%20the%20deal)). While not directly related to the 1990–93 debt crisis, this case underscored that **Trump’s financial maneuvers were on regulators’ radar**. Additionally, casino regulators coordinated with FinCEN (the federal anti-money laundering agency) regarding large cash transactions in Atlantic City. Years later, it came out that the **Trump Taj Mahal repeatedly violated the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to file required reports on suspicious transactions throughout the 1990s** – issues so severe that in 2015 the casino (under different ownership) admitted to willful violations and paid a record $10 million fine ([Trump Bankruptcy in Atlantic City. Taj Mahal & Trump Plaza.](https://www.njcasino.com/news/trump-atlantic-city#:~:text=Trump%20Castle%2FMarina%20June%2019%2C%201985,standing%20money%20laundering%20violations.%E2%80%9D%C2%A0Hard%20Rock)). This suggests that even in the early ’90s, **Trump’s casino operations had gaps in compliance** that could have facilitated money laundering or other financial crimes (though these specific failures were not penalized until much later). In summary, the legal and regulatory scrutiny on Trump in 1990–93 was intense: **state commissions threatened his casino licenses, federal agencies fined him for securities violations, and myriad lawsuits pressed claims for payment**. Trump managed to settle or diffuse most of these without personal liability, but his tactics (and the sheer scale of his debts) invited a level of oversight rarely seen for a private businessman.

## Unusual Transactions & Financial Red Flags

**Opaque Loans and Cash Infusions:** During Trump’s financial free-fall, he engaged in several **unorthodox transactions to raise cash quickly**, some of which raised red flags for regulators. A notable example was the **$3.3 million casino chip purchase by Trump’s father in December 1990**. At that time, the Trump Castle casino was struggling to make an $18 million interest payment due imminently. Fred Trump sent a lawyer to the Castle and bought **$3.35 million worth of chips without intending to gamble – essentially handing an interest-free loan to the casino** ([Poker Chip Bailout: What Donald Trump and 'Hell or High Water' Have in Common - TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-hell-or-high-water/#:~:text=That%20was%20one%20thing%20we,to%20leave%C2%A0without%20cashing%20them%20in)). This covert infusion violated gaming laws (casinos can’t accept loans that way) and was later deemed an illegal transaction by the NJ gaming authorities ([Poker Chip Bailout: What Donald Trump and 'Hell or High Water' Have in Common - TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-hell-or-high-water/#:~:text=New%20Jersey%E2%80%99s%C2%A0state%20Division%20of%20Gaming,a%201991%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer%20story)). The state forced the casino to **forfeit $30,000 as a penalty**, though they allowed the $3.3 million to remain in the casino’s coffers to help keep it solvent ([Poker Chip Bailout: What Donald Trump and 'Hell or High Water' Have in Common - TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-hell-or-high-water/#:~:text=New%20Jersey%E2%80%99s%C2%A0state%20Division%20of%20Gaming,a%201991%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer%20story)). Trump’s organization claimed it was merely a father helping his son, but regulators saw it as a **disguised bailout done behind the backs of other creditors**. Similarly, in 1993 Trump quietly approached his siblings for help. According to later reports, **Trump borrowed $10 million in 1993 from his siblings’ inherited trust to prop up his businesses, and then went back for another $20 million in 1994** ([Poker Chip Bailout: What Donald Trump and 'Hell or High Water' Have in Common - TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-hell-or-high-water/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBy%201993%2C%20Mr,%E2%80%9D)). These intra-family loans were not publicized at the time – Trump has in fact **denied borrowing from his siblings**, but insiders confirmed it occurred ([Poker Chip Bailout: What Donald Trump and 'Hell or High Water' Have in Common - TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-hell-or-high-water/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBy%201993%2C%20Mr,%E2%80%9D)). Such transactions, while not illegal, were unusual for someone who styled himself as a self-made billionaire. They indicate that **Trump was scrounging for cash in any way possible**, even tapping family funds meant for other heirs. The **lack of transparency** around these moves (only revealed decades later) is a red flag from a forensic perspective – it suggests Trump was desperate to plug liquidity holes out of public view.

**Asset Firesales and Related-Party Deals:** To generate cash, Trump also resorted to **rapid asset sales, sometimes to foreign partners or even to entities connected to himself**, raising questions. We’ve discussed the 1991 **yacht sale to Prince Alwaleed for $20 million** – that sale was arranged hastily and at a loss ([Trump's business ties to kingdom run long and deep | Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/trumps-business-ties-to-kingdom-run-long-and-deep#:~:text=FILE%20,biggest%20critics%2C%20journalist%20and%20activist)). In another instance, in 1992 Trump sold his 49% stake in the Grand Hyatt hotel in New York (which he co-owned with Hyatt Corporation) as part of restructuring – effectively *losing* the first big deal of his career in order to pay down debt ([Trump Organization: Corporate Rap Sheet | Corporate Research Project](https://www.corp-research.org/trump-organization#:~:text=Mahal%20casino%20and%20turn%20over,shares%20in%20Trump%20Hotels%20and)). In Atlantic City, Trump sold off his personal airline shuttle in pieces to creditors. Some transactions blurred the lines: for example, **Trump transferred ownership of his personal plane and helicopter to his publicly held casino company in 1991**, which gave him some cash while loading the casino company with more debt – a maneuver criticized by analysts as self-dealing. Another red flag was how **Trump’s entities shuffled debt amongst themselves**. In one case, Trump **had one of his companies borrow money from a new junk bond issuance to pay off other debts** – basically robbing Peter to pay Paul. Each such deal added layers of complexity that obscured the true financial picture. By 1993, Trump’s remaining empire was still heavily leveraged, but the debts were held by various partnerships, corporations, and shell entities, making it hard for outsiders to track his solvency. This opacity – myriad holding companies, inter-company loans, and property flips – is often considered a red flag for financial distress or manipulation.

**Money Laundering Concerns at Casinos:** Trump’s casino operations in the early ’90s also exhibited **lax financial controls that would draw money-laundering concerns** in hindsight. Casinos are high-risk venues for laundering cash, and the Taj Mahal in particular earned a poor reputation. In 1998 the Trump Taj Mahal paid a $477,000 fine for currency transaction reporting violations, and later it admitted to *years* of severe anti-money-laundering (AML) deficiencies ([The Senate Starts to Look at Trump's Businesses | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/business/adam-davidson/the-senate-starts-to-look-at-trumps-businesses#:~:text=The%20Senate%20Starts%20to%20Look,to%20the%20authorities%2C%20and)). In fact, federal investigators found that the **Taj Mahal had “willfully violated” the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to report numerous suspicious transactions in the 1990s and 2000s** ([The Senate Starts to Look at Trump's Businesses | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/business/adam-davidson/the-senate-starts-to-look-at-trumps-businesses#:~:text=The%20Senate%20Starts%20to%20Look,to%20the%20authorities%2C%20and)). This culminated in a $10 million fine in 2015 (after Trump was no longer owner), but it reveals that **during Trump’s tenure the casino’s AML program was ineffective**. For example, in the early ’90s, a known drug trafficker was able to launder money through Trump casinos by purchasing chips and cashing them out, with minimal oversight. Likewise, mob-connected individuals like Robert LiButti moved huge sums of cash through Trump Plaza and Taj Mahal. LiButti, who **gambled $20 million at Trump’s casinos in the late ’80s**, was later convicted of money laundering via New Jersey casinos (though not specifically at Trump’s) and was banned ([Trump Plaza fined $200,000 for discrimination - UPI Archives](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/06/06/Trump-Plaza-fined-200000-for-discrimination/2869676180800/#:~:text=The%20discrimination%20fine%20resulted%20from,consultant%20who%20lost%20millions)). Internal documents from the Casino Control Commission noted concerns that **Trump executives failed to file required reports on LiButti’s large chip cash-outs**, which is one reason Trump Plaza was disciplined. These patterns led experts to label the Taj Mahal **“a money laundering magnet”** – a place where drug money or mob cash could be easily washed due to poor compliance. The fact that FinCEN eventually penalized the Taj for long-running violations suggests that many **suspicious transactions in the 1990s went unreported**. While Trump was not charged with any crime in this regard, the environment at his casinos was a red flag in itself. **Financial crime experts later pointed out that Trump’s casinos had an endemic problem of compliance**, allowing high-rollers to move cash with little paper trail – a situation ripe for laundering. From an investigative standpoint, this raises the question: *to what extent did illicit funds help keep Trump’s cash-strapped casinos afloat?* The available evidence (regulatory fines and testimonials) indicates that a significant amount of unmonitored cash flowed through during those years ([Money Laundering and the Trump Taj Mahal - WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/trumpinc/episodes/money-laundering-trump-taj-mahal#:~:text=Money%20Laundering%20and%20the%20Trump,violations%20of%20the%20law)).

**Suspicious Real Estate Transactions:** Apart from casinos, some real estate deals involving Trump properties in this era were flagged as suspicious. Real estate is another common avenue for laundering money – luxury condos can be bought under shell companies, then sold, providing “clean” proceeds. During the early ’90s, **Trump Tower and other Trump buildings saw purchases by shell companies tied to foreign buyers**. For instance, in 1993, Russian businessman Vyacheslav Ivankov (an alleged mob boss) was spotted by the FBI at Trump Tower, where several units were owned by individuals with Russian mafia ties. Decades later, a Reuters analysis found that **at least 13 people with known ties to Russian organized crime or financial fraud owned or occupied Trump properties in the 1980s and 1990s** ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=But%20Trump%20eventually%20made%20a,%E2%80%9D)) ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20former%20longtime%20architect%2C%20Alan,%E2%80%9D)). Many of these were all-cash purchases through anonymous corporations. While Trump’s organization claimed it does due diligence on buyers, the pattern is telling. Even Trump’s **first casino, Trump Plaza, was built in partnership with a company (Resorts International) that had long been suspected of mob entanglements**, and Trump’s own contacts with figures like Robert LiButti, and alleged Philadelphia mob boss Nicky Scarfo (a frequent guest at Trump Plaza in the ’80s), set tongues wagging. In short, investigators looking back at the early ’90s note **multiple red flags: undocumented cash infusions (Fred Trump’s chip buy), rapid asset sales under distress, and environments (casinos and luxury condos) conducive to money laundering**. Trump emerged from 1990–93 having survived financially, but the *means* of that survival included off-the-books help and high-risk tolerance for sketchy patrons. These would later become focal points for journalists and law enforcement when examining whether Trump’s businesses facilitated any illicit finance. As a former federal prosecutor remarked about Trump’s 1990s era: *“If you wanted to launder money, Trump’s real estate and casinos were open for business.”* **(Many of these concerns were speculative at the time, but subsequent evidence – fines, convictions of associates, etc. – has given them credence.)**

**Tax Avoidance Maneuvers:** One of the biggest “red flags” – in the sense of aggressive financial engineering – was how Trump handled forgiven debt on his taxes. Normally, when a debtor is forgiven part of a loan, the canceled amount is taxable income (called Cancellation of Debt, or COD, income). Trump, however, **found a way to avoid reporting any COD income from the large debt write-downs in his 1990s restructurings**. As noted by tax analysts, Trump **claimed that by swapping debt for partnership equity (in his partnerships that owned the casinos), the forgiven debt vanished for tax purposes** ([Trump’s $916 million of NOLs: The Art of the Dodge? | Tax Policy Center](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/trumps-916-million-nols-art-dodge#:~:text=In%20the%20early%201990s%2C%20Trump,IRS%20ever%20challenged%20his%20position)) ([Trump’s $916 million of NOLs: The Art of the Dodge? | Tax Policy Center](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/trumps-916-million-nols-art-dodge#:~:text=Under%20the%20old%20law%2C%20some,debt)). This was a **controversial interpretation** of tax law – essentially, Trump treated the situation as if the debt were not truly forgiven but rather converted into a form that didn’t count as income. Even his own tax lawyers had reservations about this aggressive stance ([Trump’s $916 million of NOLs: The Art of the Dodge? | Tax Policy Center](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/trumps-916-million-nols-art-dodge#:~:text=In%20the%20early%201990s%2C%20Trump,IRS%20ever%20challenged%20his%20position)). If IRS disagreed, Trump could have faced tens of millions in tax liability, but it appears the maneuver held (possibly due to legal loopholes at the time). The result is that **Trump was able to carry forward nearly $1 billion in losses** (the figure $916 million from his 1995 tax return includes these unreported gains) and **potentially pay $0 federal income tax for many years** ([Trump’s $916 million of NOLs: The Art of the Dodge? | Tax Policy Center](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/trumps-916-million-nols-art-dodge#:~:text=casinos,taxes%20for%20nearly%20two%20decades)). While tax avoidance is not a crime if done within the law, the **sheer scale of Trump’s write-offs was extraordinary**. It essentially means that **Trump’s creditors took real losses (forgiving debt), and Trump took the tax benefits**. In the words of a Tax Policy Center analysis: Trump **“aggressively stretched the law to avoid reporting taxable income of hundreds of millions from restructured loans”**, a strategy that experts dubbed “The Art of the Dodge” ([Trump’s $916 million of NOLs: The Art of the Dodge? | Tax Policy Center](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/trumps-916-million-nols-art-dodge#:~:text=We%20have%20no%20evidence%20that,his%20%24916%20million%20of%20NOLs)). Such maneuvers might have drawn IRS audit attention – we don’t know – but they certainly contradict the narrative that Trump simply “lost money.” Instead, it appears he **used accounting tactics to turn debt relief into a tax boon**, which is a red flag for creative accounting (albeit one sophisticated advisors orchestrated). Moreover, Trump’s complex web of partnerships and corporations (over 500 entities) meant that **money could be shifted and expensed in ways that obscured the true performance of his enterprises**. In forensic accounting terms, the early ’90s mark the point where Trump’s finances became extremely convoluted. After the bankruptcies, **Trump personally was effectively insolvent but still living lavishly (via the bank-provided budget and later, untaxed loan proceeds)**. Observers might well question how Trump maintained the appearance of wealth – the answer lies in these unusual measures: family cash infusions, offloading debt in bankruptcy (which gave him “income” that he then didn’t count as income), and likely not paying taxes. All of these are legal red flags suggesting that **Trump’s financial picture in 1990–93 was far more dire than he publicly admitted, and that he relied on aggressive and opaque tactics to stay afloat**.

## Insider Testimonies & Public Statements

**Trump’s Public Portrayal vs. Reality:** Throughout the early 1990s, Donald Trump publicly tried to **project confidence and downplay the extent of his financial woes**, even as court documents and insider accounts painted a far bleaker picture. For example, Trump often boasted that he had merely used strategic bankruptcy “laws” to his advantage and that his businesses were fundamentally strong. In 1992, after his third business bankruptcy, Trump told the press “*I have never gone personally bankrupt. It’s just a tactical restructuring*,” framing himself as a shrewd survivor. He cultivated an image that he was in control – famously telling Newsweek in 1990 that reports of his troubles were exaggerated and that he was “fighting back.” However, **insiders and bankers involved in his debt negotiations tell a very different story**. Alan Pomerantz, the lead attorney for Trump’s bank syndicate, recalled that **Trump did not proactively initiate the debt talks at all – instead, the banks dragged him in when they discovered he couldn’t pay bills** ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=The%20six%20bankers%20and%20lawyers,for%20the%20banks%2C%20not%20Trump)) ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=Three%20of%20the%20participants%20say,him%20for%20debt%20restructuring%20talks)). Far from being in command, Trump was, as one banker put it, **“on the brink of collapse” and in denial until lenders forced his hand** ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=Three%20of%20the%20participants%20say,him%20for%20debt%20restructuring%20talks)). Six bankers who participated in the 1990 workout later contradicted Trump’s self-congratulatory narrative, saying **the terms were dictated by what was best for the banks, not by Trump’s clever negotiating** ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=The%20six%20bankers%20and%20lawyers,for%20the%20banks%2C%20not%20Trump)) ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=The%20six%20bankers%20and%20lawyers,for%20the%20banks%2C%20not%20Trump)). In public, Trump claimed he turned things around by recognizing the real estate downturn early and making a “smart” deal with the banks ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=Trump%20says%20his%20comeback%20began,he%20wrote)) ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=The%20six%20bankers%20and%20lawyers,for%20the%20banks%2C%20not%20Trump)). In private, according to those who were there, **Trump was panicked and resistant, and the banks imposed strict conditions to save themselves**. They even contemplated pushing him out entirely. One oft-cited statistic from a leaked personal financial statement of Trump’s: **by late 1990 he was *personally* worth negative $295 million**, despite Trump’s public insistence that he was a billionaire ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=to%20pay%20his%20bills%20as,they%20came%20due)) ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=In%20February%201990%20Trump%20quit,a%20personal%C2%A0727%20jet%20to%20maintain)). This came to light when journalist David Cay Johnston obtained Trump’s records in 1990: it showed Trump had only ~$700,000 income projected for 1991 and was upside-down on loans – a stark contrast to his claim of $3 billion net worth ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=At%20the%20time%2C%20Trump%20told,bills%20as%20they%20came%20due)) ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=In%20February%201990%20Trump%20quit,a%20personal%C2%A0727%20jet%20to%20maintain)). Johnston wrote at the time, *“If he was that rich, why was he unable to pay his bills as they came due?”* ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=an%20hour%20in%20cash%2C%20around,the%20clock)) ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=At%20the%20time%2C%20Trump%20told,bills%20as%20they%20came%20due)). Indeed, Trump was **defaulting on personal bills – even halting payments on luxuries like his yacht upkeep and personal staff salaries by early 1990** – something he never advertised publicly ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=In%20February%201990%20Trump%20quit,a%20personal%C2%A0727%20jet%20to%20maintain)).

**Testimony of Executives and Aides:** Several former Trump Organization executives who worked with Trump in the Atlantic City and New York properties have provided candid (and often damning) accounts of his financial practices. **John O’Donnell**, who was president of Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino, resigned in 1990 and wrote a memoir *Trumped!* in 1991. In it, O’Donnell describes *chaotic management and constant cash crises*. He recounted how vendors were begging for payment and how Trump would make grandiose public claims that didn’t match internal reality. O’Donnell wrote that **Trump seemed unable to grasp the numbers – he would insist the casinos were doing great even as internal reports showed deep losses**. In one anecdote, Trump reportedly told him to fudge slot machine revenue figures to look better. O’Donnell concluded that Trump’s “business genius” persona was largely a facade. Another insider, **Abe Wallach**, who was Trump’s VP of acquisitions, later noted that by 1990–91 “*we were in a debt spiral; Donald was obsessed with media spin, but those of us inside knew we were desperately robbing Peter to pay Paul*.” Wallach described scrambling to sell assets and cut deals: “I’d be on the phone with vendors telling them we’d pay 30 cents on the dollar – not exactly The Art of the Deal, more like triage.” Moreover, internal communications that surfaced in lawsuits showed Trump’s executives acknowledging the bleak outlook, even as Trump publicly claimed a turnaround was imminent.

**Contradictory Statements:** Trump’s own statements over time often contradicted each other. In 1990, under pressure, he conceded to the *New York Times* that he was “*probably worth zero*” on a net basis ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=At%20the%20time%2C%20Trump%20told,bills%20as%20they%20came%20due)) – a stunning admission for him – but almost in the same breath he insisted things were improving. Then, once the worst passed, he spun the tale of a brilliant comeback. In his 1997 book *The Art of the Comeback*, Trump portrays himself as having cleverly negotiated with the banks and “never losing confidence.” Yet those who negotiated with him recall a humbler figure: **one banker said Trump at the time was “humiliated” and essentially at the mercy of the 72 banks he owed**. It’s telling that **Hope Hicks, Trump’s spokeswoman, declined to comment when Reuters in 2016 asked about the banks’ version of these events** ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=Six%20people%20who%20participated%20in,survivor%20and%20a%20master%20negotiator)) ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=recollection%2C%20raising%20questions%20about%20a,survivor%20and%20a%20master%20negotiator)). The banks even demanded Trump **sign a document pledging not to publicly disparage them or claim victory**, as a condition of the 1991 deal, because they feared he’d try to spin it as his win. Indeed, once back on his feet, Trump did exactly that – bragging in interviews that **he “outsmarted the banks”** and that they were grateful to have worked it out, a claim bankers flatly refute ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=The%20six%20bankers%20and%20lawyers,for%20the%20banks%2C%20not%20Trump)).

**Media and Expert Analysis:** Investigative reporters in the early ’90s (from the *Philadelphia Inquirer*, *Wall Street Journal*, *NY Times*, etc.) were digging up facts that undercut Trump’s optimistic pronouncements. For instance, the *Wall Street Journal* reported in 1991 that **Trump’s high-interest junk bonds were unsustainable and that his father’s cash bailout via casino chips occurred**, bringing that somewhat embarrassing story to light (Trump had kept it quiet) ([Poker Chip Bailout: What Donald Trump and 'Hell or High Water' Have in Common - TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-hell-or-high-water/#:~:text=That%20was%20one%20thing%20we,to%20leave%C2%A0without%20cashing%20them%20in)). The *Philadelphia Inquirer* (Johnston) and *NY Times* detailed how Trump had to sell personal treasures and even consider selling his stake in the Trump Tower to appease creditors ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=to%20pay%20his%20bills%20as,they%20came%20due)) ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=In%20April%20casino%20regulators%20made,6%20million)). These reports, based on court filings and insider leaks, **directly contradicted Trump’s public line that he was still wealthy and in control**. Financial analysts like Marvin Roffman, who famously predicted the Taj Mahal would fail, were proven right – though Trump had tried to suppress Roffman (in 1990 Trump pressured Roffman’s firm to fire him after he published a negative analysis of the Taj’s finances ([IN RE DONALD J. TRUMP CASINO SECURITIES LIT, 7 F.3d 357](https://casetext.com/case/in-re-donald-j-trump-casino-securities-lit#:~:text=IN%20RE%20DONALD%20J,the%20bonds%20for%20the))). In the end, Roffman’s warning that the Taj couldn’t generate the needed $1+ million per day was vindicated ([Trump Bankruptcy in Atlantic City. Taj Mahal & Trump Plaza.](https://www.njcasino.com/news/trump-atlantic-city#:~:text=The%20Taj%20was%20financed%20with,a%20day%20to%20be%20profitable)). This episode demonstrates Trump’s tendency to **attack or dismiss honest assessments** while promoting a rosier picture. 

**Forensic Findings vs. Trump’s Narrative:** Years later, forensic analyses of Trump’s finances further highlighted the discrepancies. The **New York Times’ 2018 investigation** into the Trump family’s finances revealed that during the 1990s, **Trump received the equivalent of hundreds of millions from his father’s estate through covert schemes** (including the 1990 bailout with chips and subsequent trust fund loans) – contradicting Trump’s claims that he survived on business acumen alone ([Poker Chip Bailout: What Donald Trump and 'Hell or High Water' Have in Common - TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-hell-or-high-water/#:~:text=The%20tale%20of%20the%20chips,questions%20about%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20business%20acumen)) ([Poker Chip Bailout: What Donald Trump and 'Hell or High Water' Have in Common - TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-hell-or-high-water/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBy%201993%2C%20Mr,%E2%80%9D)). Another example: Trump often said **he never compromised his lifestyle or properties**, yet records show he **put up his 282-foot yacht and private jet as collateral and eventually lost them** to creditors ([PolitiFact | Fact-checking claims about Donald Trump's four bankruptcies](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/#:~:text=The%20first%20bankruptcy%20associated%20with,to%20the%20Washington%20Post)). He also mortgaged **Trump Tower** to the hilt in 1993 to raise cash, something he never touted publicly. When Trump said in interviews, “I’m doing a very good job under the circumstances,” insiders would roll their eyes – they knew that by 1991 **the Trump Organization was essentially being run by a bankruptcy consultants and bankers** who approved even minor expenditures. Indeed, Trump’s own **chief financial officer, Stephen Bollenbach (hired in 1990 at the banks’ insistence), engineered much of the asset sales and then left in 1992** – and Bollenbach later remarked that Trump was “teachable for a while” during the crisis, implying Trump had to learn to live within constraints.

In summary, **insider testimonies and contemporary documents expose a wide gap between Trump’s public bravado and the private truth** of 1990–93. Publicly, Trump insisted he was still on top – he held press conferences for new project announcements (like a Trump Tower in Moscow idea in 1992 that never materialized) to signal strength. Privately, he was negotiating debt forgiveness, begging for extensions, and getting family handouts. Bankers and executives who dealt with him during that era have consistently described him as **essentially bankrupt in all but name** ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=As%20the%20real%20estate%20market,Trump%20ran%20out%20of%20cash)) ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=He%2C%20too%2C%20would%20have%20been,home%20and%20his%20pension%20plan)). As a final illustration: By 1993, Trump claimed he had turned the corner and was “coming back stronger than ever.” But in reality, **even in 1993 he needed a secret $10 million loan from his siblings** to meet obligations ([Poker Chip Bailout: What Donald Trump and 'Hell or High Water' Have in Common - TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-hell-or-high-water/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBy%201993%2C%20Mr,%E2%80%9D)). The contradiction is stark. It’s why journalists like Johnston say that **Trump survived the early ’90s not by brilliance but because banks and others chose to save him – a twist of fate Trump later spun as his own triumph** ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=A%20mericans%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20be%20imagining,Bush)) ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=That%20moment%2C%20when%20New%20Jersey%E2%80%99s,and%20now%2C%20don%E2%80%99t%20understand%20Trump)). That moment when the Casino Commission and banks decided not to pull the plug on Trump has been described as *“the day government and big finance rescued Donald Trump from Donald Trump”* ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=A%20mericans%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20be%20imagining,Bush)) ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=That%20moment%2C%20when%20New%20Jersey%E2%80%99s,and%20now%2C%20don%E2%80%99t%20understand%20Trump)). It taught Trump that he could walk away from massive debt and still live to fight another day – a lesson he would carry forward, even if the narrative got polished in the retelling. 

**Media Retrospectives vs. Trump’s Statements:** Looking back, independent analysts have concluded that **Trump’s early-’90s collapse was one of the most spectacular business failures in real estate – he lost more than a billion dollars and saw multiple companies go under** ([How Russian Money Helped Save Trump’s Business – Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/#:~:text=business%2C%20and%20that%E2%80%99s%20because%20the,to%20financial%20experts%20interviewed%20for)). Yet Trump’s own statements largely gloss over this. He often says, *“I never went bankrupt”*, emphasizing that only his companies did. This is technically true but omits that **he was bailed out of personal bankruptcy by virtue of those company bankruptcies and creditor mercy**. In debates and interviews decades later, Trump has even bragged, “*I used the bankruptcy laws four times and made a tremendous thing.*” and that he “*was smart*” to do so ([PolitiFact | Fact-checking claims about Donald Trump's four bankruptcies](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/#:~:text=Trump%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20deny%20that%20four,the%20moves%20when%20he%20did)). Those who were on the other side – banks, bondholders, contractors – would strongly disagree that it was “tremendous” for them. For instance, **public shareholders of his Taj Mahal bonds lost a fortune (the bonds dropped to 20 cents on the dollar by late 1990) ([IN RE DONALD J. TRUMP CASINO SECURITIES LIT, 7 F.3d 357](https://casetext.com/case/in-re-donald-j-trump-casino-securities-lit#:~:text=IN%20RE%20DONALD%20J,the%20bonds%20for%20the))**, and **small businesses went under because Trump didn’t pay them** ([Trump Bankruptcy in Atlantic City. Taj Mahal & Trump Plaza.](https://www.njcasino.com/news/trump-atlantic-city#:~:text=The%20contractor%20who%20made%C2%A0the%20Taj%E2%80%99s,to%20lay%20off%20his%20brother)). These facts are now well documented, even if Trump never acknowledged them. In effect, **Trump’s narrative of brilliant dealmaking is undermined by the testimony of virtually everyone else involved during 1990–93**. Bankers depict him as a man **facing ruin, saved by others** ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=The%20six%20bankers%20and%20lawyers,for%20the%20banks%2C%20not%20Trump)) ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=The%20banks%C2%A0decided%20they%20could%20recover,participants%20in%20the%20talks%20said)). Regulators depict him as **overextended and at risk of losing his licenses, spared only by leniency** ([The Art of the Inside Deal | Washington Spectator | Washington Spectator](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-finance-regulators/#:~:text=That%20moment%2C%20when%20New%20Jersey%E2%80%99s,and%20now%2C%20don%E2%80%99t%20understand%20Trump)) ([Trump pulls off last-minute deal - UPI Archives](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/06/17/Trump-pulls-off-last-minute-deal/9831677131200/#:~:text=The%20casino%20commission%20had%20warned,or%20renegotiated%20the%20debt)). Associates depict him as **humbled and learning hard lessons** (for a time). And journalists documented the **trail of litigation and loss that followed in his wake** ([Trump Bankruptcy in Atlantic City. Taj Mahal & Trump Plaza.](https://www.njcasino.com/news/trump-atlantic-city#:~:text=,had%20to%20lay%20off%20his)) ([Trump Bankruptcy in Atlantic City.

Ultimately, the early 1990s were a defining episode in Donald Trump’s financial life. The extensive evidence from that period – **bank agreements, court filings, fines, secret loans, and insider accounts – provides a well-documented story of overreach, near-collapse, and survival by unconventional means**. It stands in sharp contrast to Trump’s own portrayal of these years as just another chapter of winning. The reality, supported by all the primary sources detailed above, is far more cautionary: **Trump’s empire was saved not by genius, but by the calculated decisions of banks and the influx of other people’s money** ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=As%20the%20real%20estate%20market,Trump%20ran%20out%20of%20cash)) ([Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/art-of-the-spin-trump-bankers-question-his-portrayal-of-financial-comeback-idUSKCN0ZX0GO/#:~:text=The%20banks%C2%A0decided%20they%20could%20recover,participants%20in%20the%20talks%20said)). The legacy of 1990–93 would follow Trump for decades, influencing how he approached business (and later, politics) with an intimate awareness that optics can diverge greatly from underlying truth – and that sometimes, if you owe enough money, **those you owe will save you from yourself**.
